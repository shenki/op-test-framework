## OpenPower Test Framework ##

This repository provides a collection of tools that enable automated testing of
OpenPower systems. The op-test-framework suite is designed to test a machine
largely out of band - that is, it is designed for tests that do things like
power cycle the machine, test booting different configurations. As part of the
op-test-framework, we may run tests on the host itself (such as fwts and HTX)

The end goals is to have a collection of build verification tests (bvt) that
can be run against any OpenPower system to validate it's function.  The tests
are automation/jenkins ready. The tests cover basic functionality like software
updates and low level firmware features, all the way up to OS and OPAL
functional tests.

The **common** directory is where we abstract the OpenPower system interfaces.
It provides the generic API's (and detailed implementations) of interfaces
required by the test cases.

The **bvt** directory is where the test executions are defined.  These tests
are xml based.  They may call into the common to run the tests directly or they
may call into the **testcases** directory for tests that require more logic.

The ci directory is left over from some legacy continuous integration work.
The BVT's currently use CI as a pass through to execute the tests.  We have a
TODO to remove the CI function eventually.

### Requirements ###

This framework runs on most Linux based systems.  You need the following dependencies:

 - python 2.7 or greater
 - `expect` and `pexpect`
 - perl's libxml bindings
   - Fedora: sudo yum install perl-XML-LibXML-Common
   - Ubuntu: sudo aptitude install libxml-libxml-perl
 - ipmiutil (>= 1.8.15)

You will need to run the test suite on a machine that has access to both the
BMC and the host of the machine(s) you're testing.

### Preparation ###

**Machine Configuration**

Copy the `bvt/op-machines-example.xml` file and use its layout (specified in
`bvt/op-machines.xsd`) to specify the machines in your test lab.

The `machines.xml` should be kept *private* as it will contain passwords for
machines.

**Known good firmware**

It's good to supply known good firmware so that if everything goes horribly
wrong running the regression tests, the test suite can attempt to un-brick the
machine with known good firmware.

This is useful in a lab environment where the machines are shared.

**Firmware to test**

Firmware to test can either already be on the target machine, or can be flashed
by the test harness.

Put firmware in `firmware-to-test/platform/`

For example, for `ibm,garrison platform`, `firmware-to-test/ibm,garrison/` would be
the directory to place the firmware for a Garrison machine. In this case, it
would be the `garrison.pnor` and/or HPM files.

### Running the tests ###

    ./run --machines machines.xml --machine my-openpower-box

The identifier `my-openpower-box` is the name attribute of the Machine
specified in the `machines.xml` file.

You can get more information about invoking the tests with:

    ./run --help

By default, we will run the `bvt/op-ci-basic-bvt.xml` test suite.
To run a different suite, use the `--suite` parameter.

### Test Suites ###

You can run the following suites:

* `op-ci-basic-bvt.xml`: Firmware code update(HPM Based upgradation), IPL and IPMI power control commands
* `op-opal-ci-bvt.xml`:  Flash PNOR FW and IPL
* `op-firmware-component-update-bvt.xml`: For Out-of-band FW upgrade (using hpm upgrade)
* `op-inbound-basic-bvt.xml`:  For in-band FW upgrade (hpm upgrade)
* `op-opal-fvt-bvt.xml`: For OPAL Functional tests

### Notes ###

- You need to have the `bvt` directory in your `PATH`

### TODO ###

- Should have the BVT tool call the common library directly (instead of going through CI)
- Should make the common code more generic to support alternative BMC's
- Should have bvt call the python code more directly (remove op-ci-bmc-run)
- Standardize on just expect or pexepect
